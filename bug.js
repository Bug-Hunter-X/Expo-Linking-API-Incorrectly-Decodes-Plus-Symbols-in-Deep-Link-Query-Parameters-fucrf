This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  If the app is launched from a deep link that includes a query parameter with a plus symbol (+), the value of that parameter will be incorrectly decoded. For example, if the deep link is `myapp://route?param=hello+world`, the value of `param` will be `hello world` instead of `hello+world`. This can lead to unexpected behavior in your app.
